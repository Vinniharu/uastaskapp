# Task Management Application

A modern task management application built with Next.js, designed to help teams organize and track their tasks efficiently.

## Features

- User Authentication (Staff/Admin login)
- Task Creation and Management
- Task Status Tracking
- User-friendly Interface
- Responsive Design

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to access the application.

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Main application pages and routes
- `/components` - Reusable React components
- `/lib` - Utility functions and API handlers
- `/public` - Static assets

## Technology Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework for production
- Tailwind CSS - For styling
- Next Auth - Authentication
- [Other technologies used in your project]

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Add other necessary environment variables
```

This environment variable should be used in all API calls throughout your application. For production, you would set this to your production API URL.

Remember:
- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix makes the variable available in the browser
- For development, it typically points to `http://localhost:3000`
- For production, it would point to your production API URL
- Make sure to add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file if it's not already there

Would you like me to help you implement this in any other specific files in your project?
